# Task 04 - Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data (Pure Python)

## 📌 Objective

Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands — using only **core Python (no libraries)**.

## 📁 Dataset

We refer to the [Twitter Entity Sentiment Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis), which contains tweets labeled with:
- **Entity (Brand/Topic)**  
- **Sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral)**

> ⚠️ For simplicity and per constraints, we simulate sample data manually in the code.
